# car_GUI
New suggestion for an new car GUI, just for demo purposes and nothing is connected to the buttons that something should happen. 

As Input devices I still want to stay with the awesome spin-push button as well as touch, speech (Contextual Interfaces are probably the most important input while driving) and steering wheel buttons. 
I thought of a 12" dashboard as an output device and of course sound to give the customer useful feedback while operating.

Running the Qt/QML File: 
 1.) Install QT - it#s an open source program and you can download it from here: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/?hsCtaTracking=f977210e-de67-475f-a32b-65cec207fd03%7Cd62710cd-e1db-46aa-8d4d-2f1c1ffdacea#section-2
 
 2.) Test the default program of QT with "Hello world", whether your compiler is all set and you can start creating files. 
 
 3.) Download this repository
 
 4.) Run the *.pro file
 
 5.) You should be good to go and a screen should pop up after a couple of minutes because the images needs to be loaded first.
